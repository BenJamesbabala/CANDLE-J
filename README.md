CANDLE
======

CANDLE is an image denoising algortihm that is very robust for processing deep in vivo 3D multiphoton microscopy images where the signal to noise ratio is low (SNR). The algorithm is written in Matlab with C++ components compiled in Mex. The purpose of this project is to port CANDLE from Matlab to Jython for integration into ImageJ (Fiji) as a plugin. The goal is to preserve the complete functionality of the orginal program while not compromising speed significantly.
